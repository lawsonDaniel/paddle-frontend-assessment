## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Routes
This are the following routes avaliable on this project

``` [About](http://localhost:3000/about)
	[Contact](http://localhost:3000/contact)
	[Home](http://localhost:3000/)
	[learningcenter](http://localhost:3000/learningcenter)
	[Github](http://localhost:3000/github)

```

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
